Not only did I write the music with Michael and prepare scores, I also organized the concert logistics, including hiring the group, organizing rehearsals, securing a venue, managing the audio and video recording teams, as well as marketing the event, doing the final mixes and mastering of the audio recording, and editing both the final videos you see on this page in addition to the video loops of the artwork we projected during the concert. <br /> <br /> Below is a gallery of the concert in full, as well as the individual movements. <br /> <br /> Performed by <a href="https://www.contemporaneous.org/">Contemporaneous</a>. Featuring artwork by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_hego/">HEGO</a>. <br />Filmed by <a href="https://www.universalliveav.com/">Universal Live</a>.
