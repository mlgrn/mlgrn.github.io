I auditioned and was accepted to Peabody Conservatory, Manhattan School of Music, Montclair State University, and The Hartt School. <br /> <br />I ultimately chose to go to Hartt entirely because of Robert Black. He had the most unique thing going on that provided not only <strong> *a lot* </strong> of face time with him, but a truly comprehensive artistic education. <br /> <br />A lot of conservatory bass programs focus on orchestral excerpts, an hour lesson a week with your teacher, some coursework, a recital at the end, and that is pretty much it. <br /> <br /> Robert's approach was really different. He would host a techniques class, a bass history class, a bass ensemble, coach chamber music, a weekly lesson, host studio masterclasses, require a recital each year, and for graduate students a "third event", which he encouraged to be something from our broader musical life beyond the conservatory work. <br /> <br /> And because of Robert's work as a champion of contemporary music and long history with The Bang on a Can All Stars, he not only encouraged us to directly explore composition and non-standard repertoire, but he attracted students who were very open minded. They taught me just as much as the program did. <br /> <br /> I graduated with a Master of Music degreein 2013 and model a lot of my own teaching style around this experience.`,location:"Hartford, CT, USA",logo:e.Hartt,name:"",organization:"The Hartt School",period:{from:new Date(2011,8,1),to:new Date(2013,5,1)},shortDescription:"Studied Classical and Contemporary Bass Performance with Robert Black.",slug:"education-item-2",subjects:["orchestral","chamber music","solo","composition","music theory","music pedagogy"],media:[]},{degree:"Lucerne Festival Academy - Summer Program",description:"The Lucerne Festival Academy is a summer program founded by Pierre Boulez that brings together students from all over the world to study 20th and 21st century music with some of the most renowned musicians and composers of our time. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate enough to be accepted into the full scholarship summer program several years in a row.
